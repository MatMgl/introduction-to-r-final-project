# Introduction to R – Final Project

This repository contains the final project for the *Introduction to R* course.  
It includes two distinct parts:

1. **Fractal Simulation – Barnsley Fern**  
   - Implementation of an iterative algorithm to generate the Barnsley fern fractal  
   - Custom visualization using `ggplot2`  
   - Animation of convergence over increasing number of iterations

2. **Wind Data Analysis**  
   - Import and preprocessing of real-world wind measurements (Excel data)  
   - Cleaning faulty data (e.g., sensor freezing)  
   - Sector classification based on wind direction  
   - Time series visualization of anemometer readings  
   - Vertical wind profile analysis  
   - Curve fitting with Hellmann’s power law and the logarithmic wind profile  
   - Histogram and Weibull distribution fitting for speed data  
   - Faceted and comparative plots by wind sectors

## 📦 Packages Used

- `ggplot2`
- `readxl`
- `EnvStats`
- `scales`
